            <h1>The First Line of My Code</h1>
            <p>No CSS. No JavaScript. Just HTML — the beginning of my journey.</p>

        <h2>The Reason Behind the First Line</h2>
        <p>
            The reason is that I have a passion to join a reputable industry where coding is an essential skill.
            I am a beginner in coding, and I am taking my very first step. I made my first attempt by learning HTML,
            which reflects my growth through this website. This first step has motivated me to take many more steps
            forward in my coding journey.

        <h3>“HTML Visual Experiment”</h3>
        <p>Create a visual page using only your tags:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Headings as “titles”</li>
          <li>Paragraphs as info boxes</li>
          <li>Images and iframes as visuals</li>
          <li>Lists to organize content</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        
    </body>
